Bucketing is used for sampling.
Buckets are file samples
different buckets can be given be to different analyst for data analysis.
Same type products always into same buckets
A single bucket can have multiple keys
A single key can only be in one specific bucket
Hashvalue of the key mod 2 ----> underlying principle of how keys are separated into buckets
